## Topic: How Data is Stored in Buckets & Steps to Create an S3 Bucket

Welcome to Day 18 of my **30 Days of AWS Cloud** challenge! Today, I dived into Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) to understand how data is stored and to learn the steps to create an S3 bucket. Here‚Äôs a detailed overview:

### What is Amazon S3?
Amazon S3 is a scalable object storage service designed for high durability, availability, and scalability. It allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

### How Data is Stored in S3 Buckets
- **Buckets:** Containers that store objects. Each bucket name must be globally unique.
- **Objects:** The fundamental entities stored in S3. An object consists of data, metadata, and a unique identifier (key).
- **Keys:** Unique identifiers for objects within a bucket.
- **Regions:** Buckets are created in specific AWS regions, affecting latency and data residency requirements.

### Steps to Create an S3 Bucket
1. **Sign in to AWS Management Console:**
   - Navigate to the S3 service dashboard.
2. **Create a New Bucket:**
   - Click on "Create bucket."
   - Enter a unique bucket name and select the desired region.
3. **Configure Bucket Settings:**
   - Set bucket options like versioning, logging, and tags as needed.
   - Configure public access settings and permissions according to your requirements.
4. **Review and Create:**
   - Review all configurations.
   - Click "Create bucket" to finalize.

Congratulations! You‚Äôve just created your first S3 bucket. üéâ
