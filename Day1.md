# Day 1/30: Diving into AWS Cloud ðŸš€

Hello GitHub Community!

Today marks the beginning of my 30-day journey into AWS Cloud, and I'm excited to share my progress and insights along the way.

## Understanding Cloud Computing: Key Deployment Models and Services

### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center.

### Cloud Providers
The big threeâ€”Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS)â€”are considered the established leaders. However, there are a host of other smaller or niche players that offer cloud services as well, including IBM, Alibaba, Oracle, Red Hat, DigitalOcean, and Rackspace.

### Cloud Computing Deployment Models
The cloud deployment model identifies the specific type of cloud environment based on ownership, scale, and access, as well as the cloudâ€™s nature and purpose. The location of the servers youâ€™re utilizing and who controls them are defined by a cloud deployment model. It specifies how your cloud infrastructure will look, what you can change, and whether you will be given services or will have to create everything yourself. Relationships between the infrastructure and your users are also defined by cloud deployment types.

#### Different Types of Cloud Computing Deployment Models
1. **Public Cloud**
    - The public cloud makes it possible for anybody to access systems and services.
    - **Advantages:**
      - Minimal Investment
      - No setup cost
      - No infrastructure management required
      - No maintenance
      - Dynamic Scalability
    - **Disadvantages:**
      - Less secure
      - Low customization
2. **Private Cloud**
    - Itâ€™s a one-on-one environment for a single user (customer). No need to share hardware with anyone else.
    - **Advantages:**
      - Better Control
      - Data Security and Privacy
      - Supports Legacy Systems
      - Customization
    - **Disadvantages:**
      - Less scalable
      - Costly
3. **Hybrid Cloud**
    - Combines public and private clouds, offering the best of both worlds.
    - **Advantages:**
      - Flexibility and control
      - Cost-effective
      - Enhanced security
    - **Disadvantages:**
      - Difficult to manage
      - Slow data transmission
4. **Community Cloud**
    - Allows systems and services to be accessible by a group of organizations.
    - **Advantages:**
      - Cost-effective
      - Better security
      - Shared resources
      - Suitable for collaboration and data sharing
    - **Disadvantages:**
      - Limited scalability
      - Rigid in customization

### Cloud Computing Services
There are three main types of cloud service models:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
    - Provides virtualized computing resources.
    - **Examples:** DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS, Azure, Google Compute Engine, Rackspace, Cisco Metacloud.
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
    - A platform for developers to develop, test, run, and manage applications.
    - **Examples:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos, Magento Commerce Cloud, OpenShift.
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
    - Delivers software applications over the internet.
    - **Examples:** BigCommerce, Google Apps, Salesforce, Dropbox, ZenDesk, Cisco WebEx, Slack, GoToMeeting.

Understanding these models and services helps in making informed decisions about cloud strategies. Iâ€™m looking forward to diving deeper into AWS and sharing more insights in the coming days.

Stay tuned for more updates!
