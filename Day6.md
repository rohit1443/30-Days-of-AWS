# Day 6: Deep Dive into AWS Cloud - Elastic IP

## What is an Elastic IP?
An Elastic IP (EIP) is a static, public IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. It allows you to mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account.

## Key Features
🌟 **Static IP Address:** Unlike regular public IPs, Elastic IPs do not change when instances are stopped or restarted.

🌟 **Flexibility:** Easily remap your Elastic IP to another instance, enabling quick recovery and high availability.

🌟 **No Cost for Use:** There's no charge for one Elastic IP as long as it is associated with a running instance. However, charges apply if the IP is not associated with a running instance.

## Benefits
- **Improved Resilience:** Quickly remap your Elastic IP to another instance in case of failure, ensuring minimal downtime.
- **Consistency:** Provides a consistent IP address that you can rely on for long-term use.
- **Management:** Simplifies IP management and avoids the need to update DNS records.

## How to Allocate and Associate an Elastic IP
1. **Allocate an Elastic IP:**
   - Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
   - Click on "Elastic IPs" in the left-hand menu.
   - Click "Allocate Elastic IP address."

2. **Associate the Elastic IP:**
   - Select the allocated Elastic IP.
   - Click on "Actions" and then "Associate Elastic IP address."
   - Select the instance or network interface to associate the IP with.

## Release an Elastic IP
- **To Release:**
  - Navigate to "Elastic IPs" in the EC2 dashboard.
  - Select the Elastic IP.
  - Click "Actions" and then "Release Elastic IP address."

## Important Considerations
🔹 **Charge for Unused IPs:** AWS charges for Elastic IPs not associated with a running instance to encourage efficient use.

🔹 **Limit on Elastic IPs:** Each AWS account has a default limit of 5 Elastic IPs per region.

## Common Use Cases
- **Web Hosting:** Use Elastic IPs to ensure your website remains accessible by remapping the IP address to a healthy instance if the original instance fails.
- **Corporate Applications:** Ensure consistent IP addresses for your corporate applications, simplifying firewall and VPN configurations.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Quickly switch to a standby instance in a different availability zone or region during an outage.

## Summary
Elastic IPs are a crucial feature for maintaining high availability and consistent IP addresses in AWS cloud environments. By understanding how to allocate, associate, and manage Elastic IPs, you can ensure that your applications remain resilient and accessible.
