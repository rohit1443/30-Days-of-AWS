# Day 12/30: Exploring Elastic Block Store (EBS) in AWS

Welcome to Day 12 of our 30-day AWS journey! Today, we dive into Elastic Block Store (EBS), a key component providing scalable and high-performance block storage for use with Amazon EC2 instances. Let's break down the essentials of EBS and understand its features, benefits, and use cases.

## What is Amazon EBS?
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a cloud-based storage service designed to be used with Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud). EBS provides persistent block-level storage volumes that can be attached to your EC2 instances. These volumes are automatically replicated within their Availability Zone, ensuring high availability and durability.

## Key Features of Amazon EBS

- **Persistent Storage**: EBS volumes persist independently from the running life of an EC2 instance, ensuring data safety even if the instance is terminated.
- **Scalability**: Easily increase storage size, adjust performance characteristics, and change the volume type with minimal impact on your applications.
- **Snapshot Support**: Create point-in-time snapshots of EBS volumes, stored in Amazon S3 for easy data backup and recovery.
- **Encryption**: Supports encryption for data at rest and in transit, ensuring data security.
- **High Performance**: Offers various volume types designed for different performance requirements, including SSD-backed and HDD-backed volumes.

## Types of EBS Volumes

- **General Purpose SSD (gp3 and gp2)**:
  - **gp3**: Baseline performance of 3,000 IOPS, scalable up to 16,000 IOPS and 1,000 MB/s throughput.
  - **gp2**: Baseline performance of 3 IOPS per GB, bursting up to 3,000 IOPS.
- **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2 and io1)**:
  - **io2**: For critical applications requiring sustained high performance, up to 64,000 IOPS and 1,000 MB/s throughput.
  - **io1**: Similar to io2 with slightly less performance and availability.
- **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)**: Ideal for large, sequential workloads like big data, with throughput up to 500 MB/s.
- **Cold HDD (sc1)**: Low-cost option for infrequently accessed data, with throughput up to 250 MB/s.

## Benefits of Using Amazon EBS

- **Reliability and Durability**: EBS volumes are designed for 99.999% availability and are replicated within the same Availability Zone.
- **Flexibility and Ease of Use**: Easily manage and scale storage volumes via the AWS Management Console, CLI, or API.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Choose the right volume type for your needs and pay only for what you use.
- **High Performance**: Meet demanding application needs with low latency and high throughput.
- **Data Security**: Built-in encryption and integration with AWS KMS for robust data protection.

## Common Use Cases for Amazon EBS

- **Database Storage**: High IOPS and low latency for databases like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
- **Big Data Analytics**: Store and process large datasets with high throughput requirements.
- **Backup and Restore**: Create snapshots for data backup and disaster recovery.
- **Enterprise Applications**: Run mission-critical applications requiring consistent performance and high availability.
- **Dev/Test Environments**: Rapidly provision storage for development and testing.

## Getting Started with Amazon EBS

1. **Create an EBS Volume**:
   - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
   - Select "Volumes" and click "Create Volume".
   - Choose the volume type, size, and availability zone, then click "Create Volume".

2. **Attach the Volume to an EC2 Instance**:
   - Select the volume, click "Actions", and choose "Attach Volume".
   - Select the instance and click "Attach".

3. **Format and Mount the Volume**:
   - Connect to your EC2 instance via SSH.
   - Use `mkfs` to format and `mount` to mount the volume to a directory.
